Version 0.3
===========
- Fixed a problem in the handling of repeated keys on X11.
- Starting in window mode on X11 with mouse grab enabled and with automatic
  focusing of new windows disabled no longer results in an onfocused window
  you can't select.
- Fixed rcon to work again.
- Removed the obsolete m_side and m_forward cvars.

Version 0.2
===========
- Rewrote the QW networking code.
- New ruleset code including EQL support.

Version 0.1 (since Fuhquake 0.31)
=================================
- Rewrote build system. It no longer sucks.
- Support for big endian systems.
- Support for 64 bit systems.
- Support for MorphOS.
- Support for FreeBSD.
- Support for NetBSD.
- Support for Nintendo Wii.
- Support for IPv6.
- Many fixes to the X11 support, including fullscreen support.
- GLX and X11 now share the same mouse code, which has had many improvements.
- Clipboard support for X11.
- Support for building Win32 target with MinGW.
- Non-platform specific code (lots of software rendering logic, mouse
  acceleration handling, etc...) has been moved out from the platform
  specific files where the code was previously duplicated before.
- FTE-compatible support for compression of network data.
- Command line arguments are no longer needed. Every option can be set by
  regular Quake cvars. Command line options are converted into their
  respective cvars for legacy reasons.
- Sound system parameters can be changed while Quake is running and sound can
  be completely turned on/off as well without a restart.
- Fixed several security issues.
- General code clean up. Now uses fewer globals, especially doesnn't use
  globals for argument passing.
- Console ctrl+pageup/pagedown scrolling fixed to scroll the correct amount of
  lines in all cases. That means always having one line from the previous page
  visible.
- Fixed an issue with small s_mixahead values and long QW uptimes.
- No longer consumes 100% CPU time when much less is actually required.
- Fixed GLX support for smart drivers and graphics hardware which isn't fast
  enough.
- Fixed various issues with displays that don't have a 4:3 ratio.
- Added support for FTE chunked downloads. Downloads can be much faster now on
  compatible servers.
- Now works correctly as a spectator on servers which support
  Z_EXT_PM_TYPE/Z_EXT_PM_TYPE_NEW.
- Added scr_scoreboard_titleseperator, set to 1 draws the original QW
  scoreboard title seperator.
- No longer lets broken mods (hint: they start with the letters 'kt') change
  the rate cvar. If the server asks for the cvar to be changed, only the
  userinfo will be changed, and the value will be restored when disconneting
  from the server.
- '%%' can now be used to output a literal '%' in chat strings.
- Removed the 'lookstrafe', 'lookspring', 'freelook', 'v_centermove',
  'v_centerspeed', 'cl_anglespeedkey' and 'cl_movespeedkey' cvars and the
  '+mlook', '-mlook', '+klook', '-klook', '+speed', '-speed', '+strafe',
  '-strafe' and 'centerview' commands.
- Added a server browser (made by Jogi)
- Added file checksumming used by f_modified.
- Added a video mode selection menu.
- ALSA support ripped off from FTE.
